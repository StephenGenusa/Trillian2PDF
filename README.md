# Trillian Messenger Client History to PDF

This was a weekend project to get Trillian.im message history converted to a nicely formatted PDF for archival/searching purposes. It's a throw together hack and will not be updated but I'm posting it here on GitHub in the hopes I can save others some time if they need something like this.
